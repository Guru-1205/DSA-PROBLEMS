/**
 * LeetCode 2181: Merge Nodes in Between Zeros
 *
 * Problem:
 * You are given the head of a linked list that contains integers. The list
 * starts and ends with 0,
 * and there are no consecutive zeroes. Each non-zero segment is between two
 * zeroes.
 * For each such segment, merge the nodes into a single node whose value is the
 * sum of that segment.
 * Return the head of the modified list (excluding the leading and trailing
 * zeros).
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
 * Output: [4,11]
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * Efficient Approach (One Pass Summation)
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * Step 1: Initialize pointers
 * - current = head.next (skip the first zero)
 * - dummy node for building result
 * - tail pointer for appending merged nodes
 *
 * Step 2: Traverse the list
 * - Maintain a running sum.
 * - Add node values until a zero is encountered.
 *
 * Step 3: On encountering zero
 * - Create a new node with the accumulated sum.
 * - Append it to the result list.
 * - Reset sum to 0 for the next segment.
 *
 * Step 4: Continue until the end
 * - The final zero will trigger the last merged node.
 * - Return dummy.next as the new head.
 *
 * Intuition:
 * - Each segment between zeros is independent.
 * - We just need to accumulate values until we hit a zero and then flush the
 * sum.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n), each node visited once
 * Space Complexity: O(1), only pointers used
